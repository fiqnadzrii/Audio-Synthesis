I programmed a full 1:30 minute audio cover of Alan Walker's "Faded" using the Csound language. Developed complex sound textures by programming oscillators, ADSR envelopes, and vibrato effects.
Implemented various opcodes for sound generation, including oscillators, envelopes, and vibrato effects. Also created and optimized instruments for realistic audio simulations and dynamic sound textures.

Due to hardware issues during the audio synthesis process, the exported WAV file encountered compatibility issues with the compiler, resulting in audio artifacts.
